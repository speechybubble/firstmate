# Codex

Verified on 2026-06-11 with codex-cli 0.139.0 unless a fact gives a newer version.

## Operating facts

| Fact | Value |
|---|---|
| Busy state | Unknown until a semantic source is live-verified: the app-server turn lifecycle is unreachable for a pane worker, and project lifecycle hooks did not fire for a Firstmate-launched worker. |
| Exit command | `/quit`; its slash popup needs about one second between text and Enter, which the shared submit path used by the control plane handles. |
| Interrupt | Single Escape. |
| Skill invocation | `$<skill>`, for example `$no-mistakes`; `/<skill>` is Claude-only and Codex rejects it as "Unrecognized command". |
| Resume | `codex resume <session-id>`, using the id printed on quit. |
| Model flag | `--model <model>`. |
| Effort flag | `-c 'model_reasoning_effort="<low\|medium\|high\|xhigh\|max>"'`, verified on codex-cli 0.142.1 whose installed schema contains `model_reasoning_effort`, active config uses it, and bundled catalog advertised only the first four values while omitting `max`; current codex-cli 0.153.4 catalog data at `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/models_cache.json` advertises `max` for `gpt-5.6-luna`, which Firstmate passes for that model. |
| Model discovery | Open the current interactive session's `/model` picker. |
| Marker | None; identity comes from ancestry, and `../../../bin/fm-harness.sh` is what keeps a retained foreign `CLAUDECODE` from renaming it. Verified on 2026-09-01 with codex-cli 0.152.0: the pane process is the `node` npm shim and the native `codex` binary runs as its foreground child, so a tool subprocess reaches the native name directly while the shim itself is identified from its script path. |

A directory trust dialog appears on the first run for a repository root: "Do you trust the contents of this directory?"
Accept it with Enter and verify the instructions begin processing.
The decision persists for the repository, so later worktrees of the same project skip it.

## Hook trust

A second dialog, "Hooks need review - N hooks are new or changed", appears whenever the machine's `~/.codex/hooks.json` or a project's own `.codex/hooks.json` carries a hook Codex has not persisted trust for.
For version-scoped normal review navigation, see [bounded native Codex evidence](../../../../../docs/verification/runtime-backends.md#codex-parked-turn-ownership-bounded-native-evidence).
Use it only for the exact fixture or project whose trust review is authorized, then inspect the active counts and verify native execution.
Writing Codex's trust store would manufacture consent; `--dangerously-bypass-hook-trust` runs untrusted hooks rather than disabling them, so neither substitutes for normal review.
Crewmate/scout launches still disable project hooks through `bin/fm-spawn.sh`; normal primary hook review does not broaden trust or change worker launch policy.
Secondmates keep their own primary hooks and require normal review of new or changed entries.

## Skill popup

A `$<skill>` invocation opens a `$` autocomplete popup.
Submitting too fast lets the popup swallow Enter, so the invocation never lands.
`../../../bin/fm-send.sh` gives a leading `$` a 1.2-second settle before the first Enter only when the exact task metadata records `harness=codex`, with the target backend's submit retry as the safety net.
That scope is load-bearing because a leading `$` commonly starts ordinary text such as `$5/month` or `$HOME`.
An explicit `session:window` target has no metadata, so its harness is unknown and uses the non-Codex fast path.
This is why `$no-mistakes` reaches a Codex worker instead of being consumed by the popup.

## Primary integration

The primary integration was verified on 2026-07-08 with codex-cli 0.142.1.
The firstmate primary's `.codex/hooks.json` registers a Stop hook that pipes Codex's payload to `../../../bin/fm-turnend-guard.sh`.
Codex Stop hooks preserve exit status 2 and stderr to block, and expose `stop_hook_active` for the same one-block loop safety used by the guard's default mode.

The Stop payload includes `cwd`, but the tracked hook does not use it to choose the guard executable.
Codex runs the Stop command with process PWD set to the hook-loaded project root, while no `CODEX_PROJECT_DIR`, `CODEX_WORKSPACE_ROOT`, or `CODEX_CWD` root variable is set.
The tracked hook anchors to `pwd -P`, verifies that root is Firstmate-shaped and hook-bearing, and then invokes the guard with the original payload.

Codex's watcher protocol, recovery and limits are owned by [the Codex supervision protocol](../../../../../docs/supervision-protocols/codex.md).
For configured supervision-host behavior during a checkpoint, see [the supervision-host contract](../../../../../docs/supervision-host.md).
Codex's PreToolUse watcher-arm seatbelt blocks directly through its project hook.
